                Half of the fun of watching a movie is choosing what you are going to watch. 
                But where do you begin? Due to the sheer amount of choices available, it can be 
                quite difficult to pick one movie to watch.
                
                Have you ever been confused by a large array of movies about which you know nothing?
                How do you decide?
                
                Deciding what to watch can be the most difficult part of movie night. Ultimately, 
                finding the right film comes down to personal preference,
                but I’ve rounded up some insights to consider when you’re searching about the movie(s).

                <blockquote>
                    "If it is a good movie, the sound could go off and the audience would still have a 
                perfectly clear idea of what was going on."

                <blockquote>
                    "Watching a really good movie excites me, because it makes me want to get up off the 
                couch and go shoot something and act in a scene.And music excites me because it puts
                me in a mind state, whatever that may be."

                that I don't like it any more."
